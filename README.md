# Fishing-Mechanic-Prototype
Based in the "Webfishing" main mechanic.  ​  In this prototype, the player can throw a fishing hook to any water surffice and try to catch a fish.  ​  When a fish bites the hook, an interface bar appears where the player must fill a bar by pressing a button and repeatedly tapping to break through different barriers that segment progress.
